<!-- <br/><img src='/images/About Me.png'> -->

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Aleks Rakic group (Photonics Engineering Group) at The University of Queensland (UQ), specialising in terahertz (THz) nanophotonics and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). I completed my Ph.D. at UQ, focusing on SNOM. I'm a lecturer and co-teach a third-year course: ELEC3100 Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Waves and Fields with Prof. [Aleksandar D. Rakić](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/473) since 2024.

Previously, I earned an M.S. from The University of Hong Kong, studying deep learning for image segmentation, and a B.Sc. from Northeastern University, where I researched spin wave dynamics and piezoelectric nanodevices.

<!-- I am holding a position of Postdoctoral Research Fellow at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia). My research interests include scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), terahertz (THz), and nanophotonics.

I get my PhD in Dec., 2022 from the University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia) specifically for **THz SNOM inverse problems** to extract complex permittivity and interpret unexpected observations from unknown nanostructures, e.g., compound semiconductor nanodevices.

Before that, I obtained my Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Hong Kong (Dec.,2018). My thesis is about **deep learning image segmentation** assissted by generative adversarial network.

I received my B.Sc. (Applied Physics) from Northeastern University (June, 2017) with a thesis topic in studying **spin wave dynamics** in magnetic materials via **Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations**. During my 2nd to 3rd year, I stay in nanodevice lab out of my lecture times to work on **piezoelectric nanodevices based on ZnO nanoarrays** with applications in gas sensing and waste water treatment. -->
