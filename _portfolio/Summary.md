excerpt: "
- **Aug. 17-22, 2025**: IRMMW-THz 2025 in Finland. A 15-min oral presented by Jari; Sad cannot speak my session due to teaching tasks. Let's meet in 2026 somewhere face to face again.

- **Dec. 1-6, 2024**: Xiao will give an oral presentation as well as a 30-min talk for attocube s-SONM workshop in NFO-17 / AIP Congress 2024 [held in Melbourne]! It is the first time for Xiao to attend near-field optics conferences! Stay tuned! [Update: Amazing vibes! Looking forward to NFO-18 in Brno, Czech Republic]

- **Nov. 15-18, 2024**: Xiao has been honoured to ask as the interim chair for morning sessions in ISUPTW 2024 [THz part] and also delivered an invited talk about THz nanoscopy. (Thanks Prof. Tianwu Wang)

- **Sep. 1, 2024**: Xiao has given an invited student workshop seminar in IRMMW-THz 2024 in Perth, Australia. (Thanks Prof. Vincent Wallace and Prof. Aleksandar D. Rakić)

- **April 10, 2024**: Xiao's invited review article about THz nanoscopy [Applied Physics Review] is selected as Feature article by Editors!

- **May 2023**: We get a front cover on JPCL! It is about a THz spectral anomaly found on Tantalum oxides (UQ Electrical Engineering and Physics Collaboration)

- **March 22nd, 2023**: The investigation of polaritonic features and surfaced doped property of nominally high-resistivity silicon nanodevices has been finally accepted on Nanophotonics! (UQ Electrical Engineering and Physics Collaboration)

- **Dec. 16, 2022**: I obtained my PhD degree! Thanks my adviors (Prof. Aleksandar D. Rakić and Dr. Karl Bertling) and my examination committee (Prof. Roger Lewis, Prof. Mengkun Liu, and committee chair Prof. Markus Barth)! 

- **May 2022**: Xiao participated 2nd International Nanoscale Analytics Workshop (Munich, Germany) --- for the first time to enter Europe and for the first time see SNOM leading experts face to face, not just on the papers! Bravo!

- **2021**: We get a front cover and Edtors' pick-up on APL! (UQ Electrical Engineering and Physics Collaboration)

- **January, 2021**: My first paper in my PhD get published on APL! My s-SNOM journey begins from here.
