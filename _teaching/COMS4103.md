From 2019 to 2021, I'm the teaching assissant of this 4-th year undergraduate-level course. My duties include leading lab pracs (characterisation of I-V curves and emission profiles of VCSEL, DFB, and FP lasers), marking lab reports, weekly contact-hour sessions (tutorials to demonstrate solving problems), invigilating mid-term exams.
