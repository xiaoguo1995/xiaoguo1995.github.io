In 2025 Semester 2, I'm lecturer of this third-year compulsory course (>200 students) and co-teach with senior colleagues (Prof. Aleksandar D. Rakić). See [course profile](https://course-profiles.uq.edu.au/course-profiles/ELEC3100-60789-7560#course-overview)

**My teaching duties** (12 teaching weeks + 1 swotvac week + ...):
- 40\% course coordination. 
- deliver lectures (Wave Propogation, Lossy Media, Plasma, Waveguide, EM Potentials, Radiation, and Antenna) [2 hrs / wk], 
- prepare weekly 6 new oral examination problems and solutions (offer on-site help) [4 hrs / wk],
- prepare and deliver weekly contact-hour session with 6 solved problems [1 hr / wk)],
- prepare final exam and supplementary exam problems, solutions, and step-by-step marking criteria,
- prepare and coordinate oral examination (applied class) with tutors to update weekly marking progress,
- deal with posted questions on online Ed discussion boards (Q&A sessions) [> 3 hrs / week].
