Observe surface plasmon polaritonic features in nominally high-resistiviy silicon-based quantum devices and reconstruct the multilayer nanostructure complex permittivity and the supported polariton dispersion curve.

Demonstrate a multilayer extraction procedure for THz s-SNOM, extended on my calibration method working on bulk systems (Guo2021a).
