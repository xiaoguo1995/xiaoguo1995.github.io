Reveal unconsidered fabrication-induced doping on nominally high-resistivity silicon transmission line in coplanar waveguide structure for superconducting quantum computing by extracting both real and imaginary part of complex permittivity and fitted by Drude model.

We demonstrate THz s-SNOM works on unknown silicon-based nanostructures.
