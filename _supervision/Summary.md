Congrats to my students
- Seijun Stokes (co-supervised with Aleks : )): Seijun is an Electrical Engineering / Biomedical Engineering Student and he is eager and delicated to do cool stuff for his PhD in Germany (EU). He has applied for PhD programs in a few places and waiting for results. If you come across this website and has an interesting bio-related project with PhD scholarship, please consider him : )
